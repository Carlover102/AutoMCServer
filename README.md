# AutoMCServer

This is a project for those who don't know have the technical knowledge to create a Minecraft Server or those who don't want to.

Please leave any comments/suggestions on how I could improve this project. (It's appreciated)

Thanks for using my work!

# Instructions

# **Warning: This only works on linux/debian devices**.  Windows is in developement.

After you download the project:
1. Extract it into whatever folder you want to.

2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory.

3. Run **python3 script_main.py** in the terminal. Note - If you don't have Python installed, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for help.

*If you want to download the files from the command line instead, then type* **cd ~/Downloads** *then* **wget -O AutoMCServer.zip "https://github.com/Carlover102/AutoMCServer/archive/main.zip"** *and it will download the same files.*

# Thanks Again! And, remember, questions/comments are appreciated.
